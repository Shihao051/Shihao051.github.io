I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics at UC San Diego. My research lies in an emerging field within Applied & Interdisciplinary Mathematics, which involves Information Theory, Data Science, Signal Processing and Machine Learning. My recent works focus on developing new theory and algorithms of post training quantization and low-rank compensation of LLMs.
